Data Source: Alabama Department of Public Health Infectious Diseases & Outbreaks Division. All data is provisional and subject to change.
 
Data Definitions:
 
Total Tested primarily represents tests that were satisfactorily performed by the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) Bureau of Clinical Laboratories (BCL), along with some data from commercial labs. Commercial labs are required by law to report positive and negative tests results to ADPH. Some commercial labs do not report negative results. Total tested also includes test results from persons who were tested in Alabama but do not reside in Alabama. This is the only data provided on the dashboard that includes persons from other states.

Testing Sites are facilities who have reported to ADPH that they are collecting specimens for COVID-19. This map does not reflect all collection sites in Alabama. Call the testing site for additional information before visiting. Or call the Alabama COVID-19 24/7 hotline at 1-888-264-2256 for testing sites and hours of operation near you. interpreters are available.

MEDSIS is a centralized system used by state, tribal, and county public health users to track and manage cases of COVID-19.

Testing: Currently, all COVID-19 lab results are reportable to the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS). A large majority of these results are received through Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR). All data in this dashboard is compiled from data received through this method.

Hospital Capacity: EMResource is an online platform providing the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) the ability to understand operational statuses and infrastructure capabilities of healthcare facilities statewide. It creates situational awareness by enabling the Department to view up-to-date hospital statuses, bed and resource availability. The real-time visibility into the current status and patient throughput information aids the Department in providing healthcare that best fit Arizonans’ needs. This data is self-reported data from each of the hospitals. It is pulled at 5 pm every day and updated at 9 am the next day. This data is required to be reported to the Arizona Department of Health Services according to Executive Order 2020-23.

Syndromic Surveil: These data have limitations that must be considered when interpreting findings.  Variability may occur day to day in the capture and submission of data to the BioSense Platform. Not all hospitals participate in the BioSense Platform, so visits to non-participating hospitals are not available in the data.  Very limited data from select urgent care clinics participating as a pilot project."

Information about Healthcare Coalition Regions is available on the MDHHS website.

This information has been compiled by the Michigan Health & Hospital Association (MHA) on behalf of the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS). The data is from the state of Michigan's EMResource data system. Hospitals are required to enter data into EMResource. The data reflects the status in the hospital or health system from the previous 48 hour period.

The information is aggregated by health system for those hospitals that are part of a health system. This is because systems are centrally tracking and distributing personal protection equipment (PPE) amongst their various facilities and looking at patient surge and load from a system perspective. Non-system hospitals are identified as individual hospitals.

The data reflects the status in health systems and hospitals 48 hours prior to the time that the data was posted to this website.

*Note on deaths (04/30/20): Regular reviews of death certificate data maintained in Vital Records reporting systems are conducted by MDHHS staff three times per week. As a part of this process, records that identify COVID-19 infection as a contributing factor to death are compared against all laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate the individual died, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified. These matched deaths are then included with mortality information posted to the Michigan Coronavirus website. As a result of the most recent assessment, today’s data includes 40 additional deaths identified by this methodology.

Syndromic Surveillance System data is obtained from approximately 183 facilities participating in syndromic surveillance (132 Emergency Departments (ED), 51 Urgent Cares) across the State of Michigan. The reporting is based on individuals who present at EDs and may not be representative of the overall population.

Data are updated once a day around 5:45pm. As local public health departments and laboratories identify new information about cases, there will be corrections that result in changes to this data. Changes may include a small increase or decrease in cumulative counts or counts on prior days.

Note on reported laboratory testing: Testing data includes results from both the state public health laboratory and reference laboratories. Testing data are meant to provide a rough estimate of testing volume. Due to different source data, numbers may differ slightly from day to day.

Note on reported positive cases: A positive case is defined as a person with a COVID-19 positive laboratory result. Positive cases are reported to state and local health departments as soon as results are available. There may be a lag in the reporting at the state level. Case counts are presented based on the date of report to public health. Case counts may differ slightly from day to day or may change on prior days as public health investigations identify new information. 

Note on county-level data: County-level data changes rapidly as local health departments identify new cases. Local health departments determine the appropriate county during their public health investigation. If the local health department has not yet identified the county of residence, the case will be included in the statewide total but will not be mapped to a county. If a positive case is reported and it is determined that the person isn’t a resident of that particular county, it will be moved to the appropriate county. In the event of a discrepancy between Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) cases and cases reported by local public health officials, data reported by the local health department should be considered the most up to date.

Note on reported deaths: Death information is compiled from several sources. Some deaths may be reported locally by health care providers, hospitals, medical examiners/coroners, local health departments, or others before they are included in the statewide count. In order to be counted in statewide totals, death counts must recorded by the local health department.

Note on hospital capacity measures: Data are updated once a day and are a point in time snap shot of the hospital capacity.

In 2003, NCDPH created a hospital-based Public Health Epidemiologist (PHE) program to strengthen coordination and communication between hospitals, health departments and the state. The PHE program covers approximately 38 percent of general/acute care beds and 40 percent of ED visits in the state. PHEs play a critical role in assuring routine and urgent communicable disease control, hospital reporting of communicable diseases, outbreak management and case finding during community wide outbreaks.

North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NC EDSS)

NC EDSS, the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System, is a component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to move states to web-based health surveillance and reporting systems. NC EDSS is also part of the Public Health Information Network (PHIN). The electronic system replaced a patchwork of smaller disease-specific surveillance systems and paper-based reporting.

NC EDSS is used by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, the state's 86 local and multi-county district health departments (LHDs), and eight HIV/STD Regional Offices. Laboratories also report electronically to NC EDSS.

NC EDSS creates a central repository of person-based public health data. Local Health Departments collect and enter the data included in the dashboard, including COVID cases, COVID deaths, and demographic information for cases.

ReadyOp

Data on hospitalizations, hospital beds, and ventilators is collected using the ReadyOp system. This system uses a survey to collect self-reported data from hospitals. The data are reported throughout the day and collected and aggregated daily. The percent of hospitals reporting to the survey statewide is updated daily. The percent responding may change.

Congregate Living Setting

In a congregate living setting, a COVID-19 outbreak is defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases. An outbreak is considered over if there is not evidence of continued transmission within the facility. This is measured as 28 days after the person identified as the last case began having symptoms, or their date of specimen collection if they didn’t have symptoms. If another case is detected in a facility after an outbreak is declared over, the outbreak is not reopened. It is counted as a case in congregate living settings, and if a second case is detected within 28 days in the same facility, it is considered a second, new outbreak in that facility.

Cases are considered hospitalized if they were ever admitted to the hospital for inpatient care during the their COVID-19 illness. Cases who were examined in but not admitted to a hospital may be incorrectly classified as hospitalized until interview and medical record review are complete, leading to fluctuations in the number of hospitalized COVID-19 cases.

As reported to Oregon’s Hospital Capacity Web System (HOSCAP). Every hospital in Oregon is asked to submit data twice daily HOSCAP. Hospital staff are asked to enter bed capacity information, by type, as well as the numbers of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness who are currently hospitalized at the time of data entry. These data may conflict with hospitalization status in Orpheus due to case reporting and investigation lags and temporary discrepancies in case classification.

Negative results may have up to a 72-hour lag before being reported and results prior to March 19th may be under-reported. Laboratory positives may not match confirmed cases due to ongoing investigations and confirmatory testing. When available, laboratory data is shown by the date a sample was tested. If unavailable, it is shown by the date reported to public health.

Case data: As of 4/15, case data are displayed by both the date the first positive laboratory result (FPLR) is reported to public health and the self-reported symptom onset date. Previously this was reported by the first day a person was reported (through laboratory results or contact tracing) to public health. The FPLR date will provide a more stable estimate of the new cases reported to public health, however, there will be small differences in cases by date as public health receives additional information. Onset date is taken preferentially from the following dates when available: 1) self-reported date of first symptoms, 2) date diagnosed by a clinician, 3) date first positive specimen was collected, 4) first report to public health. The actual number of cases in Utah is higher than what is reported due to mild cases not feeling ill enough to seek care, clinician judgement for testing, and expanding laboratory capacity.

Hospitalization Data: Hospitalizations in this table represent the total number of cases that have been admitted to hospitals. This count does not represent the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the hospital. Hospitalization data is collected from patient interviews and medical chart abstractions by Local Health Departments (LHDs). While UDOH and LHDs capture most hospitalizations through provider reporting, some patients may be hospitalized after the case was investigated by an LHD and therefore not included in this count. Hospitalizations by age may not sum to total hospitalizations because some cases are initially reported without complete age data.

Demographic data: There will be small count differences in data presented by age groups, self-reported sex, and hospitalization status. This is because some cases are not initially reported with all of these data elements and unknowns are excluded from this report. Case data will be updated as local health departments (LHDs) and the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) complete investigations.
Race & Ethnicity: Race and ethnicity groups follow Census estimates for race alone or in combination in order to provide a broad snapshot of Utah’s growing diversity, including the many multi-racial and multi-ethnic individuals who call Utah home. Groups are not mutually exclusive and will not sum to total."
